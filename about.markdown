I'm Michael Berkowitz, a web developer, musician, and a [Pennystocking Silver](https://profit.ly/content/PennystockingSilver) and [StocksToTrade Pro](https://stockstotrade.com/pro) member just beginning my trading journey.

In January of 2020 I started a nightly habit of tweeting what I'd learned/done during the day with the hashtag `#1percentbetter`
in order to hold myself accountable to my goal of becoming a consistently profitable trader. The hashtag comes from James Altucher's
idea that if you improve yourself 1% each day, after 100% days you aren't just 100% better, but like compounding interest, you've
improved yourself over 250%.

I realized that 280 characters was only enough space to hold myself accountable, not to go into detail about what I was learning.
One of the things I love about the trading community I'm slowly becoming a part of is how invested everyone is in everyone else,
and this blog is my way of continuing to pay that forward.

The name of the blog comes from James Altucher's idea about the compounding 1% each day that I described above. It also references
Adam Smith's statement that self-interest is one of the most important motivators for economic activity. He describes thus it in  _The Wealth of Nations_

> It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.

My goal with Compounding Self-Interest is to combine these two ideas, with the hope that by providing a place for me to keep myself motivated
and thinking deeply about my journey, I can provide insights and encouragement to other traders so that we can each start compounding our own 1% each day.

If you're reading, thank you for joining me, and I hope I can help you along the way.
